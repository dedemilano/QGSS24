Lab 1 - Quantum Circuit Transpilation
This lab will show you how to work with Qiskit's transpilation capabilities in order to generate hardware-compliant quantum circuits for a given quantum algorithm. Specifically, this lab introduces you to the different aspects of transpilation before highlighting the adapatability of Qiskit's transpilation and demonstrating how to create your own transpilation passes.

Lab 2: Utility-Scale Layer Fidelity Experiment
Samantha Barron, Haimeng Zhang

In this lab we will show a guided construction of how to calculate the EPLG (Error Per Layered Gate) and LF (Layer Fidelity). These metrics quantify error rates in a circuit, and are particularly useful in understanding the overhead required to run error mitigation at utility-scale workloads.
