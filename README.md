Lab 1 - Quantum Circuit Transpilation
This lab will show you how to work with Qiskit's transpilation capabilities in order to generate hardware-compliant quantum circuits for a given quantum algorithm. Specifically, this lab introduces you to the different aspects of transpilation before highlighting the adapatability of Qiskit's transpilation and demonstrating how to create your own transpilation passes.
