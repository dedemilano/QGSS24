Lab 1 - Quantum Circuit Transpilation
This lab will show you how to work with Qiskit's transpilation capabilities in order to generate hardware-compliant quantum circuits for a given quantum algorithm. Specifically, this lab introduces you to the different aspects of transpilation before highlighting the adapatability of Qiskit's transpilation and demonstrating how to create your own transpilation passes.

Lab 2: Utility-Scale Layer Fidelity Experiment
Samantha Barron, Haimeng Zhang

In this lab we will show a guided construction of how to calculate the EPLG (Error Per Layered Gate) and LF (Layer Fidelity). These metrics quantify error rates in a circuit, and are particularly useful in understanding the overhead required to run error mitigation at utility-scale workloads.

Lab 3 - Quantum Error Suppression and Mitigation with Qiskit Runtime
In this lab, you will explore the error suppression and error mitigation options available with the Estimator primitive from Qiskit Runtime. You will construct a circuit and observables and submit jobs using the Estimator primitive using different combinations of error mitigation settings. Then, you will plot the results to observe the effects of the various settings.

Lab 4 Simulating Nature at Utility Scale
In this lab we will explore utility scale work by simulating the dynamics of a large Heisenberg spin chain. The goal is to measure the dynamics of 
 for a given site as a function of time and external field 
 for two different phases of the spin chain.

This lab will be broken into sections matching the Qiskit Patterns framework which include the following steps:

Map the system to quantum circuits and operators
Optimize the circuits to be executed
Execute the time evolution circuits
Analyze or post-process the results
